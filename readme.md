This is a collection of usefull Python Scripts, collected while learn how to code with Python. 


To run function from programming_languages, it needs to be imported.

```python
import programming_languages
```

But it's also possible to edit the (hidden) .replit file and change the ```entrypoint = "main.py"``` value to something else!
